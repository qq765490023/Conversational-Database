# Conversational-Database
Conversational Database. Here, I propose a concept called "conversational database", that can learn from conversation 
and retrieve previously stored data to answer current question, it should have the ability of reasoning as well as maybe 
even with the skill of performing actions.

1. keywords regarding memory like "is" "have" "can" "can be" are set to extract and store information and reason basing on it.
2. primitive actions can be provided to the system and follows different strategy of combination to produce more powerful 
actions through conversational interaction or just use re-inforcelearning.
3. relationship policies between sentences and emotional variables can also be added here to make it more funny also controlling policy.
4. logs of the system. for meta cognition or further reasoning.
